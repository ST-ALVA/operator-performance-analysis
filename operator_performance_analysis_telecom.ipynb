    "# Telecommunications Analytics: Identifying Inefficient Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "CallMeMaybe, a virtual telephony service provider, is developing a new feature to help supervisors **identify underperforming operators** and improve overall operational efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "An operator is considered **inefficient** if they exhibit one or more of the following behaviors:\n",
    "- A high volume of missed incoming calls (internal or external)\n",
    "- Excessive waiting time for incoming calls\n",
    "- Low volume of outbound calls when outbound activity is part of their role\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this analysis is to build a **data-driven, statistically validated framework** that allows supervisors to detect inefficiencies early and take targeted corrective actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Objectives\n",
    "- Perform an in-depth **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**\n",

    "- Execute outbound calls through assigned operators\n",
    "- Enable internal calls between operators within the organization\n",

    "## Data Preprocessing and Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Before performing any exploratory analysis or statistical testing, a comprehensive data validation process is carried out to ensure data integrity and logical consistency. This stage aims to prevent issues caused by incorrect data types, logical inconsistencies, extreme values, or missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once this phase is completed, the dataset will be reliable and consistent, providing a solid foundation for visualizations, aggregations, and statistical analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Validation and preprocessing steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data type conversion**\n",
    "   - Ensure that key columns such as `date`, `call_duration`, `total_call_duration`, `internal`, and other relevant fields are assigned the correct data types (`datetime`, `float`, `bool`, etc.).\n",
    "   - Verify that any derived or enriched columns are also properly typed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Missing or empty value inspection**\n",
    "   - Identify columns containing missing or empty values that could affect downstream analysis.\n",
    "   - Decide whether these values should be imputed, removed, or flagged for further inspection.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Duplicate detection**\n",
    "   - Check for duplicate records based on unique identifiers (such as `call_id`) or meaningful combinations of key columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Range validation**\n",
    "   - Confirm that call durations are non-negative.\n",
    "   - Ensure that `call_duration` does not exceed `total_call_duration`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Logical consistency checks**\n",
    "   - Validate rules such as: if `direction == 'in'`, an `operator_id` should be present.\n",
    "   - If `internal == True`, the call should not be classified as external.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Derived column validation**\n",
    "   - Confirm that `waiting_time = total_call_duration - call_duration`.\n",
    "   - Verify that daily and operator-level aggregations are consistent with the original raw data.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Extreme outlier handling (if applicable)**\n",
    "   - Detect potential outliers in variables such as `call_duration` and `waiting_time` (e.g., calls longer than two hours).\n",
    "   - Decide whether to exclude these cases or analyze them separately."

    "## 🧹 Data Preprocessing Summary (`calls` and `clients`)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Data Type Conversion and Initial Date Handling\n",
    "- The `date` column was converted to `datetime` format to enable temporal analysis.\n",
    "- A timezone-free column (`date_no_tz`) was created to ensure consistent date comparisons.\n",
    "- Missing values were identified in the `internal` column. To address this, a new binary column `is_internal` was created to explicitly and consistently distinguish internal calls throughout the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. `operator_id` Analysis and Validity Flags\n",
    "- The `operator_id` column was converted to `object` type to avoid decimal formatting issues.\n",
    "- A total of **8,172 missing values** were detected in `operator_id` and systematically classified based on call direction (`in`, `out`), internal/external status, and call duration.\n",
    "- Most missing values correspond to missed inbound calls, which motivated the creation of the explanatory column `missing_op_reason`.\n",
    "- Within the `outbound_internal_with_duration` category, **8 calls** were identified, **7 of which belong to user `168252`**.\n",
    "- Additionally, **114 calls** were classified under the `other` category, **84 of which also correspond to user `168252`**, suggesting a potential data anomaly or atypical behavior for that customer.\n",
    "- A new column, `valid_op_call`, was created to identify calls that:\n",
    "  - Have an assigned operator (`operator_id` not null)\n",
    "  - Have `total_call_duration > 0`\n",
    "  - May include cases where `call_duration == 0`, as long as the call involved operator handling (e.g., waiting time)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Duplicate Detection and Removal\n",
    "- **4,900 exact duplicate records** were identified and removed.\n",
    "- Additional duplicates were detected and removed using a key-based approach with the following columns:  \n",
    "  `user_id`, `operator_id`, `date_no_tz`, `direction`, `call_duration`, and `total_call_duration`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Logical Consistency Checks\n",
    "- No calls with negative durations were found.\n",
    "- No records where `call_duration > total_call_duration` were detected.\n",
    "- No records with `calls_count < 0` exist.\n",
    "- The following inconsistencies were identified and corrected:\n",
    "  - **68 inbound calls** without an assigned operator — already correctly marked as invalid (`valid_op_call = False`).\n",
    "  - **296 calls** marked as missed (`is_missed_call = True`) despite having positive call duration — corrected to `is_missed_call = False`.\n",
    "  - **17 calls** with zero duration (`call_duration == 0`) that were not marked as missed — reclassified as `is_missed_call = True`.\n",
    "- After these corrections, the `valid_op_call` column was recalculated to ensure consistency across the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Waiting Time Calculation\n",
    "- Two new waiting time metrics were created:\n",
    "  - `waiting_time_missed`: for missed calls (`call_duration == 0`)\n",
    "  - `waiting_time_valid`: for answered calls (`call_duration > 0`)\n",
    "- Waiting time was calculated as `total_call_duration - call_duration`, and both columns were cast to `Int64` for consistency.\n",
    "- All zero waiting time cases were verified and found to be logically valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Outlier Detection and Flagging\n",
    "- Extreme values were observed in key metrics:\n",
    "  - **`call_duration`**: up to **144,395 seconds** (~40 hours)\n",
    "  - **`waiting_time_valid`**: up to **46,474 seconds** (~13 hours)\n",
    "- Practical thresholds were defined:\n",
    "  - Calls longer than **2 hours** were flagged as `is_outlier_duration = True` (**944 cases**).\n",
    "  - Waiting times longer than **15 minutes** were flagged as `is_outlier_wait = True` (**1,475 cases**).\n",
    "- Instead of removing these records, they were **explicitly flagged** to allow differentiated analysis in later stages if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 📂 `clients` Table Preprocessing\n",
    "- The `date_start` column was converted to `datetime` format.\n",
    "- No missing values or duplicated records were found, either at the row level or by `user_id`.\n",
    "- The dataset contains three unique tariff plans: **A, B, and C**.\n",
    "- Contract start dates range from **2019-08-01 to 2019-10-31**, fully aligned with the analysis period.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Final Outcome\n",
    "After this preprocessing phase, the dataset was transformed into a **clean, consistent, and analytically robust foundation**, ensuring:\n",
    "- Logical consistency across all call records\n",
    "- Removal of redundant data\n",
    "- Explicit identification of anomalies and edge cases\n",
    "- Enrichment with key operational metrics such as waiting times, call validity flags, and operator assignment reasons\n",
    "\n",
    "This validated dataset provides a **reliable base for exploratory analysis, operator performance evaluation, and statistical testing** in the subsequent stages of the project."

    "\n",
    "Before starting the exploratory analysis, a dedicated data enrichment stage was carried out to better understand the structure of the dataset and to construct the key metrics required to evaluate operator performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "A critical finding at this stage is that each row in the dataset represents a **conversation**, not an individual call. This distinction is fundamental and directly informs the design and interpretation of all subsequent metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the event-level data, multiple operator-level indicators were derived by aggregating information at the `operator_id` level. The main enriched metrics include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`wait_avg_op`**: Average waiting time for inbound external conversations, calculated excluding extreme outliers.\n",
    "- **`wait_avg_internal`**: Average waiting time for inbound internal conversations.\n",
    "- **`conv_missed_ratio`**: Proportion of missed inbound external conversations per operator.\n",
    "- **`conv_missed_ratio_internas`**: Proportion of missed inbound internal conversations.\n",
    "- **`conv_out_total`**: Total number of outbound external conversations initiated by the operator.\n",
    "- **`internal_call_ratio`**: Share of internal conversations relative to the operator’s total activity.\n",
    "- **`call_to_wait_ratio`**: Ratio between effective call duration and total waiting time, explored as an experimental efficiency indicator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these features consolidate a primary analytical dataset at the **operator level**, which serves as the foundation for all subsequent exploratory analysis and performance evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, a behavioral classification logic was implemented to segment operators by activity profile. An **`outgoing_ratio`** was computed to represent the proportion of outbound conversations initiated by each operator. Based on this ratio, operators were classified into the following categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`outbound`**: Operators exclusively performing outbound conversations.\n",
    "- **`inbound`**: Operators primarily handling inbound conversations.\n",
    "- **`mixed`**: Operators combining inbound and outbound activity.\n",
    "- **`unknown`**: Operators without sufficient information to be reliably classified.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Before refinement:** 40 operators  \n",
    "- **After refinement:** **24 operators**\n",

    "Importantly, no classification rules or thresholds were changed. The improvement comes solely from **cleaning the metric inputs**, ensuring that inefficiency signals reflect **persistent behavioral patterns rather than isolated anomalies**.\n",

    "As a result, the remaining operators in this subset exhibit **clear structural issues**, including:\n",
    "- High missed-conversation ratios,\n",
    "- Consistently long waiting times,\n",
    "- Misalignment with expected operational roles (e.g., outbound operators with minimal activity).\n",

    "## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Key Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "During this exploratory analysis, multiple operator-level metrics were evaluated to understand performance patterns, detect anomalies, and systematically classify operators based on efficiency. The main findings are summarized below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Outlier Detection and Initial Adjustments\n",
    "Several extreme values were identified in variables such as `call_duration`, `waiting_time_ttl`, and `calls_count`, mainly driven by long conversations or sessions with multiple calls.  \n",
    "These values were considered **operationally valid**, as they reflect real call-center scenarios.  \n",
    "To avoid distortion while preserving realistic behavior, a **targeted outlier filter based on `calls_count`** was applied, removing only the most extreme cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Operator-Level Metrics\n",
    "After cleaning, key metrics were aggregated at the operator level, including:\n",
    "- Average waiting times (`wait_avg_op`, `wait_avg_internal`)\n",
    "- Missed conversation ratios (`conv_missed_ratio`, `conv_missed_ratio_internas`)\n",
    "- Outbound activity volume (`conv_out_total`)\n",
    "\n",
    "While many operators showed acceptable performance, the distributions exhibited high dispersion, motivating the use of **operator-type–aware thresholds**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Inefficiency Rules and Flagging\n",
    "Multiple inefficiency flags were defined using percentile-based and rule-based thresholds:\n",
    "- High waiting times (global P75)\n",
    "- High missed conversation ratios (>30%)\n",
    "- Low outbound activity for outbound operators (Q1-based thresholds)\n",
    "\n",
    "Operators accumulating **two or more flags** were classified as *inefficient*, resulting in **90 operators** initially identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Escalation of Extreme One-Flag Cases\n",
    "A subset of operators showed **only one flag but extreme behavior**, such as:\n",
    "- `wait_avg_op > 400`\n",
    "- `wait_avg_internal > 100`\n",
    "- `conv_missed_ratio > 20%`\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid underestimating risk, **24 of these operators** were escalated and reclassified as inefficient, bringing the total to **114 inefficient operators**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Borderline Operators\n",
    "A separate *borderline* group was defined to capture operators with:\n",
    "- Exactly one inefficiency flag, without extreme values\n",
    "- Outbound operators with moderately low outbound volumes (`conv_out_total` between 3 and 7)\n",
    "\n",
    "This group includes **110 operators** who are not currently inefficient but should be monitored due to proximity to risk thresholds.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Final Observations\n",
    "- Inefficient operators consistently show higher waiting times, higher abandonment ratios, and lower activity levels.\n",
    "- Borderline operators exhibit more balanced metrics but remain close to critical thresholds.\n",
    "- The combined approach (flags + extreme-case escalation + borderline monitoring) provides a robust and interpretable classification framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "This EDA establishes a **proactive, data-driven operator monitoring system** that:\n",
    "- Preserves realistic operational variability\n",
    "- Avoids arbitrary exclusions\n",
    "- Adapts to different operator roles\n",
    "- Enables early intervention before performance degradation becomes critical\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting framework serves as a strong foundation for downstream statistical testing and operational decision-making."

    "## Statistical Validation Design for Operational Inefficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "To validate that the classification of inefficient operators is statistically grounded, we perform hypothesis testing to directly compare their key performance metrics against those of efficient operators. The goal is to confirm the presence of **consistent and statistically significant numerical differences** that support the rule-based labeling strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although multiple subgroup comparisons were initially considered, the final validation strategy is intentionally simplified to focus on **two core comparisons**, using **non-parametric tests (Mann–Whitney U)** with **one-sided alternative hypotheses** aligned with expected operational behavior.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Non-outbound operators** are evaluated using efficiency and service-quality metrics (waiting times and missed conversation ratios), which directly reflect responsiveness and operational load.\n",
    "- **Outbound operators** follow a different operational role; therefore, validation focuses on **activity volume metrics**, where lower values indicate underperformance.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Final Sprint Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this sprint was to evaluate operator-level performance, identify operational inefficiencies, and build a robust foundation for continuous monitoring supported by objective metrics and statistical validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔧 Data Preprocessing and Enrichment\n",
    "\n",
    "The project began with an extensive data cleaning and validation process, including duplicate removal, format standardization, logical consistency checks, and validation of temporal ranges.  \n",
    "Afterwards, a set of derived metrics was constructed to capture operator performance from multiple perspectives, covering both inbound and outbound activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "This preprocessing phase ensured that all subsequent analyses were based on reliable, coherent, and operationally meaningful data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📊 Key Metrics Evaluated\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Metrics for non-outbound operators**\n",
    "\n",
    "These metrics capture general operational efficiency:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `wait_avg_op` — Average customer waiting time.  \n",
    "- `wait_avg_internal` — Waiting time during internal transfers.  \n",
    "- `conv_missed_ratio` — Proportion of missed external conversations.  \n",
    "- `conv_missed_ratio_internas` — Proportion of missed internal conversations.  \n",
    "- `calls_count_total` — Total number of handled calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Shared metric across all operators**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `conv_out_total` — Total number of outbound conversations handled.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Outbound-specific metrics**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `calls_out_total` — Total outbound calls placed.  \n",
    "- `outbound_calls_avg` — Average daily outbound call volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧩 Operator Classification Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "Operators were segmented using a rule-based system built on distribution percentiles and expected operational behavior:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Efficient:** Stable performance with favorable metric values.  \n",
    "- **Inefficient:** Persistent underperformance across multiple indicators.  \n",
    "- **Borderline:** Near critical thresholds, representing potential operational risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "This structure allows both immediate intervention and proactive monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔬 Statistical Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "To validate the classification logic, non-parametric **Mann–Whitney U tests** were applied:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inefficient operators showed significantly higher waiting times and higher missed conversation ratios.\n",
    "- Inefficient outbound operators exhibited significantly lower activity levels and call volumes.\n",
    "- All tested differences were statistically significant (p-values < 2%).\n",
    "\n",
    "These results confirm that the classification is not heuristic, but statistically grounded.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Prioritize direct intervention for inefficient operators.  \n",
    "2. Closely monitor borderline operators to prevent performance degradation.  \n",
    "3. Evaluate outbound operators using role-specific metrics.  \n",
    "4. Implement automated alerts when key performance indicators deteriorate.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "This project was reviewed across multiple analytical checkpoints, covering data preparation, enrichment, exploratory analysis, statistical validation, and visualization design. The following highlights summarize the external review feedback by stage:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Data Preprocessing & Validation**\n",
    "The reviewer emphasized the depth and rigor of the preprocessing phase. Beyond basic cleaning, the analysis applied structured logical validations, careful handling of missing values, consistent type transformations, and thorough verification of identifier integrity (including `operator_id`). The classification and validation of non-operator calls were particularly noted for their precision and cross-checking logic, resulting in a highly reliable analytical dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Data Enrichment & Feature Construction**\n",
    "The enrichment stage was highlighted as a key strength of the project. Derived metrics were clearly defined, logically justified, and closely aligned with operational efficiency goals. The transformation of raw transactional data into operator-level performance indicators created a robust analytical foundation for subsequent exploration and modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**\n",
    "The EDA was praised for its strong methodological structure and decision-oriented focus. Visualizations were not only descriptive but purpose-driven, supporting a nuanced evaluation of operator performance. The use of percentile-based thresholds, segmentation by operator type (inbound, outbound, mixed), and the identification of borderline cases demonstrated a mature, context-aware analytical approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Statistical Validation**\n",
    "The statistical validation design was described as rigorous and well-aligned with the underlying data structure. The use of non-parametric tests, clear hypothesis framing, and separation by operational profiles ensured that conclusions were statistically sound rather than intuitive. This stage reinforced the robustness of the operator classification system.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Visualization & Dashboard Design**\n",
    "The visualization strategy and Tableau dashboard design were noted for their clarity and actionability. Metrics selection, graphical structure, and visual hierarchy enable stakeholders to quickly identify patterns, inefficiencies, and intervention points. The Tableau implementation was well-supported by the prior analytical work in Python, forming a coherent end-to-end analytical workflow.\n",

    "## Final Reviewer Feedback 🏁\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-success\">\n",
    "This project reaches a level of excellence that stands out clearly. <b>Its technical quality, methodological coherence, and clarity of communication make it a strong example of advanced, decision-oriented operational analysis.</b><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most outstanding aspects is the **depth of preprocessing**. Rather than limiting the work to basic data cleaning, the analysis implements **a robust system of logical validations, intelligent corrections, and structured enrichment.** This groundwork ensured that all subsequent metrics were reliable, consistent, and comparable. The creation of derived variables, outlier identification, and conversation reclassification demonstrate strong command of the **full data lifecycle.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **dataset enrichment** further elevates the project, transforming complex transactional records into an analytical repository that captures key operator behaviors. Metrics related to waiting times, efficiency ratios, activity levels, and operational classifications reflect a **deep understanding of both the business context and the indicators that truly matter.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** is notable for its completeness and conceptual clarity. Rather than simply identifying trends, the analysis constructs a coherent framework for understanding call center operations. The segmentation of inbound, outbound, and mixed operators is well justified and precisely executed. The hybrid system of flags and thresholds **effectively combines statistical reasoning, operational logic, and critical judgment.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **statistical validation** stage further strengthens the project. The use of Mann–Whitney U tests, one-sided hypotheses, and structured group comparisons ensures that conclusions are statistically supported rather than intuitive. Demonstrating significant differences across all key metrics for inefficient operators reinforces the **credibility of the entire classification system.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the **Tableau dashboard design** reflects a professional level of visual communication. Group comparisons, individual operator distributions, and the day-by-day heatmap provide strong strategic value by revealing workload patterns and operational bottlenecks. **Visual choices, color palette, and layout support clarity and decision-making.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overall,** this project goes beyond meeting requirements. It demonstrates **rigor, depth, and clarity — core attributes of high-quality operational analytics.**\n",
